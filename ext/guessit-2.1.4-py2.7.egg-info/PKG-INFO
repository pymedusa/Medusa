        GuessIt is a python library that extracts as much information as possible from a video filename.
        
        It has a very powerful matcher that allows to guess properties from a video using its filename only.
        This matcher works with both movies and tv shows episodes.
        
        For example, GuessIt can do the following::
        
            $ guessit "Treme.1x03.Right.Place,.Wrong.Time.HDTV.XviD-NoTV.avi"
            For: Treme.1x03.Right.Place,.Wrong.Time.HDTV.XviD-NoTV.avi
            GuessIt found: {
                "title": "Treme",
                "season": 1,
                "episode": 3,
                "episode_title": "Right Place, Wrong Time",
                "format": "HDTV",
                "video_codec": "XviD",
                "release_group": "NoTV",
                "container": "avi",
                "mimetype": "video/x-msvideo",
                "type": "episode"
            }

        Migration note
        --------------
        GuessIt 2 has been rewriten from scratch. GuessIt is now a release name parser only, and support for additional
        features like hashes computations has been dropped.
        
        To migrate from guessit ``0.x`` or ``1.x``, please read
        `migration.rst <https://github.com/guessit-io/guessit/blob/master/docs/migration.rst>`_.
        
        Install
        -------
        
        Installing GuessIt is simple with `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_::
        
            $ pip install guessit
        
        You can also `install GuessIt from sources <https://github.com/guessit-io/guessit/blob/master/docs/sources.rst>`_

        It can also be used as a python module::
        
            >>> from guessit import guessit
            >>> guessit('Treme.1x03.Right.Place,.Wrong.Time.HDTV.XviD-NoTV.avi')
            MatchesDict([('title', 'Treme'), ('season', 1), ('episode', 3), ('episode_title', 'Right Place, Wrong Time'), ('format', 'HDTV'), ('video_codec', 'XviD'), ('release_group', 'NoTV'), ('container', 'avi'), ('mimetype', 'video/x-msvideo'), ('type', 'episode')])
        
        ``MatchesDict`` is a dict that keeps matches ordering.
        
        Command line options can be given as dict or string to the second argument.
